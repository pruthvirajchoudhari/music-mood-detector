# music-mood-detector

Machine Learning Project
Here a hierarchical framework is presented to automate the task of mood detection from music data.
Deep learning approach is used for the task of on-line continuous-time music mood regression, i.e.,
low- latency prediction of the time-varying arousal and valence in musical pieces. A large set of
segmental acoustic features is extracted to model short-term variations.
